Module 9 Challenge NODE.js Markdown Generator.

This weeks challenge was to make a README Generator using Nodejs. Using the index.js to create all the questions and the generateMarkdown.js file was used to display all the descriptions to each section for the questions answered when a user types "node index.js" after that user will follow the prompts to answer all the question that the creator made. once and=swered the README.md than will than reflect what the user entered.

for the index.js and the generateMarkdown.js my tutor got me started as i finished the rest of it.
